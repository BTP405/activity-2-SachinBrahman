1. (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
    Approach 1 creates a function which uses a for loop to iterare over a range of `n-1`
    values, doubles each value and appends it to the empty list. It then uses another for
    loop to call doubleL and passes 5 as an argument and prints the doubled values, each
    followed by a colon.

    Approch 2 uses list comprehension (a concise way to make lists, commonly used to make
    new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each element
    of another iterable(from Python docs)) to generate a list of doubled values in a range
    of 5 (0-4) and prints out the values, each followed by a colon.

    Approach 3 defines the doubleG function which yields doubled values from 0 to n-1 using
    a for loop and yield statement. The next for loop prints the yielded values, each value 
    followed by a colon.

2. (3 points) What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?
    `doubleG(n)` is a generator function. They are useful because they only produce values
    one at a time and as they are needed which can help save memory, compared to creating
    a list all at once. This is even more useful in the case of large datasets.
